                    <p>Harry and his two sidekicks, Hermoine and Ron, are intuitively the most central characters, as the stories revolve around them. Let&rsquo;s see if the intuition is reflected in the wiki pages!</p>
<p>The degrees of the three friends are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Character</strong></th>
<th style="text-align:center"><strong>Total degree</strong></th>
<th style="text-align:center"><strong>In-degree</strong></th>
<th style="text-align:center"><strong>Out-degree</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Harry Potter</td>
<td style="text-align:center">294</td>
<td style="text-align:center">178</td>
<td style="text-align:center">116</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hermione Granger</td>
<td style="text-align:center">226</td>
<td style="text-align:center">138</td>
<td style="text-align:center">88</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ron Weasly</td>
<td style="text-align:center">157</td>
<td style="text-align:center">58</td>
<td style="text-align:center">99</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>From the distribution of all total degrees of the characters in <a href="https://jennyjyu.github.io/socialgraphs-projectB/posts/post-3/">last post</a> (the red plot), it is clear that Harry is the one with the highest degree. This does make sense as he is the main character. Hermione has a degree of 226, meaning that she is the character with the third highest degree. Ron is more among some other characters with a degree of 115.</p>
<p><img src="https://jennyjyu.github.io/socialgraphs-projectB//images/venner.png" alt="image description"></p>
<h3 id="how-important-are-his-friends">How important are his friends?</h3>
<p>One of the questions from Project A was <em>&ldquo;How important are his friends?&quot;</em>. Now we know that Hermione is appearantly quite important, as she has a high total degree, whereas the majority is from the in-degree. Ron, on the other hand, is sadly not as important. His total degree is lower than the other two, in addition to having most of it coming from his out-degree. The latter meaning that his degree is mostly due to him mentioning many other characters.</p>
<p>Still, they are both among the upper part of the degree distribution. Hence, even though they are not <em>as</em> important as each other and Harry, they do still play a central part.</p>
<h3 id="other-centrality-measures">Other centrality measures</h3>
<p>To get an even better understanding of the importance of Harry and his friends, there are more centrality measures to look at. In the table below, the closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality for each of the three characters are presented:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Character</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Closeness</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Betweenness</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Eigenvector</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Harry Potter</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0.902</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0.196</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0.272</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hermione Granger</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0.752</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0.074</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0.246</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ron Weasley</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0.564</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0.041</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0.124</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <strong>closeness</strong> is defined so that if a vertex is close to every other vertex, then the value is larger than if the vertex is not close to everything else <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/closeness-centrality#:~:text=require%20many%20steps.-,Closeness%20centrality%20is%20a%20measure%20of%20the%20average%20shortest%20distance,distance%20to%20all%20other%20vertices">[source]</a>. As seen in the table, it shows that Harry is closer to the other nodes in the entire network, in comparison with Hermione and Ron. As for degree, their order is decreasing from Harry to Hermoine to Ron.</p>
<p>To calculate <strong>betweenness</strong>, each node receives a score based on the number of shortest paths that pass through the node. Nodes that more frequently lie on shortest paths between other nodes will have higher betweenness centrality scores <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/betweenness-centrality/#:~:text=Betweenness%20centrality%20is%20a%20way,of%20nodes%20in%20a%20graph.">[source]</a>. Again, the order of the characters with respect to their betweenness score is the same. For betweenness there is also a larger gap between Harry&rsquo;s value and the other two, compared with closeness.</p>
<p>The <strong>eigenvector</strong> is a measure of the influence of a node in a network. A high eigenvector score means that a node is connected to many nodes who also have high scores <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector_centrality#:~:text=In%20graph%20theory%2C%20eigenvector%20centrality,a%20node%20in%20a%20network.&amp;text=A%20high%20eigenvector%20score%20means,who%20themselves%20have%20high%20scores.">[source]</a>. For this measure, Harry and Hermione&rsquo;s values are closer. Ron&rsquo;s value still differs more.</p>

                    <p>As mentioned earlier, the students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry belongs to one of the four Houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. But what does each Hogwarts House actually respresent?
All the four Houses has distinctive values and characteristics which are important according the traditions and history of the House. We have produced wordclouds for each House from the texts that was collected from Wiki Fandom page for each character that belong to the House.</p>

                    <p>To get a little better understanding of the &ldquo;interactions&rdquo; going on between the wiki pages we will look at the degree distributions of the different characters, and let that decide how popular a character is. The degree distributions are deduced by the links from the different wiki pages. If a character X mentiones (and thus links to) character Y, they will have one higher count on the out-degree and in-degree, respectively.</p>
