      <description>In Harry Potter, there are many characters. That includes both allies and friends of Harry, enemies in terms of school mate rivals, enemies in terms of characters who want him killed, and others who are somewhat neutral.
Their school, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has four, so-called, houses:
 Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw  The different houses have signature colors to their uniforms; red, green, yellow and blue, respectively.</description>

      <description>To get a better understanding of how the wiki is set up, and maybe get a better understanding of coming results, it is interesting to look at the different distributions within the data set.
Species Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the species first!
As seen, most of the characters who are important characters are categorized as humans. The wiki does distinguish between if a wizard is a muggle-born, half-blood or pure-blood when categorizing them as human.</description>

      <description>To get a little better understanding of the &amp;ldquo;interactions&amp;rdquo; going on between the wiki pages we will look at the degree distributions of the different characters, and let that decide how popular a character is. The degree distributions are deduced by the links from the different wiki pages. If a character X mentiones (and thus links to) character Y, they will have one higher count on the out-degree and in-degree, respectively.</description>

      <title>4 - Centrality of Harry and his Friends</title>
      <link>https://jennyjyu.github.io/socialgraphs-projectB/posts/post-4/</link>

      <description>Harry and his two sidekicks, Hermoine and Ron, are intuitively the most central characters, as the stories revolve around them. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if the intuition is reflected in the wiki pages!
The degrees of the three friends are as follows:
   Character Total degree In-degree Out-degree     Harry Potter 294 178 116   Hermione Granger 226 138 88   Ron Weasly 157 58 99    From the distribution of all total degrees of the characters in last post (the red plot), it is clear that Harry is the one with the highest degree.</description>

      <description>As mentioned earlier, the students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry belongs to one of the four Houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. But what does each Hogwarts House actually respresent?
All the four Houses has distinctive values and characteristics which are important according the traditions and history of the House. We have produced wordclouds for each House from the texts that was collected from Wiki Fandom page for each character that belong to the House.</description>
