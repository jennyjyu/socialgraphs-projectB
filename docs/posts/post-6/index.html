                    <p>As mentioned earlier, the students at <em>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</em> belong to one of the four Houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. But what does each Hogwarts House actually represent?</p>
<p>All the four Houses have distinctive values and characteristics which are important according to the traditions and history of the House. We have produced <strong>wordclouds</strong> for each House from the texts that were collected from the Wiki Fandom page for each character that belongs to the House. A <em>wordcloud</em> is a graphical representation of the frequency of words in a text. The bigger a word appears, the more often it’s mentioned within a given text and the more important it is.</p>
<p>Every house has its own emblematic animal which is a lion, snake, eagle and badger for the house of Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw respectively. These symbols are the inspiration for the design of the wordclouds presented below.</p>
<p><strong>Gryffindor</strong>
<img src="https://jennyjyu.github.io/socialgraphs-projectB//images/wc_griffin.png" alt="image description"></p>
<p>From the wordcloud we can deduce that <em>Voldemort</em>, <em>death</em> and <em>battle</em> are the three most mentioned words on the Gryffindors wikipages. The Gryffindors are in fact known for their chivalry, daring and bravery which reflects why these words are of such importance. The bravery tends to come in handy when fighting dark wizards.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of Gryffindors is the importance of friendship and the desire to help others, especially when it comes to protecting their friends. This is reflected by the terms <em>friend</em> and <em>family</em> in the wordcloud. Harry, Hermione and Ron have a very strong friendship and it is said that <em>a Gryffindor friendship can overcome (almost) anything</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Slytherin</strong>
<img src="https://jennyjyu.github.io/socialgraphs-projectB//images/wc_slytherin.png" alt="image description"></p>
<p>Ambition, resourcefulness and intellect are characteristics that can place you in Slytherin. From the wordcloud we see that <em>Voldemort</em> and <em>death</em> are the most mentioned terms. This can be related to the fact that Slytherin has a reputation for being an evil House due to its connection to villainous characters.</p>
<p><strong>Ravenclaw</strong>
<img src="https://jennyjyu.github.io/socialgraphs-projectB//images/wc_ravenclaw.png" alt="image description"></p>
<p>Characters that belong to the House of Ravenclaw are known to be intelligent and hard-working students. This can be deduced from the wordcloud where we can observe that the words <em>school</em>, <em>professor</em> and <em>student</em> are of importance.</p>
<p><strong>Hufflepuff</strong>
<img src="https://jennyjyu.github.io/socialgraphs-projectB//images/wc_hufflepuff.png" alt="image description"></p>
<p>From the wordcloud we see that some of the most mentioned terms are <em>school</em>, <em>friend</em> and <em>student</em>. Hufflepuffs are known for being trustworthy, loyal and hardworking people.</p>
<p>We observe that the terms <em>Voldemort</em> and <em>death</em> have lower importance compared to Slytherin and Gryffindor. This can be related to the fact that Hufflepuff has produced the fewest Dark witches and wizards of any House.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown</strong>
<img src="https://jennyjyu.github.io/socialgraphs-projectB//images/wc_undefined.png" alt="image description"></p>
<p>The <em>Unknown</em> category includes people, creatures, pets etc. who have not gone to Hogwarts and do not belong to any of the houses. From the wordcloud we observe that <em>Voldemort</em>, <em>ministry</em> and <em>magic</em> are some of the most frequent terms. This seems reasonable as many of the people in the unknown category are part of the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p>It is clear that the wordclouds gives an insight into the most important traits related to each House. The characteristics of each House can be deduced by studying the wordcloud, but it is definitely easier for someone with domain knowledge about the Harry Potter universe.</p>

                <section class="post-card-excerpt">
                    <p>To decide which characters are the most important ones, we looked at the degree distributions of the different characters. To get a more detailed explanation of the degree distributions and how these were deduced, see post 3 - The Degree Distribution.
The top 5 most important characters according to the in-degree and out-degree are presented in the tabels below.
   Character In-degree     Harry Potter 178   Hermione Granger 138   Albus Dumbledore 132   Draco Malfoy 94   Severus Snape 93       Character Out-degree     Harry Potter 116   Albus Dumbledore 110   Ronald Weasley 99   Hermione Granger 88   Tom Riddle 88    As expected, we can see that Harry, Hermione and Ron are some of the most central characters.</p>
