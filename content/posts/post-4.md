Harry and his two sidekicks, Hermoine and Ron, are intuitively the most central characters, as the stories revolve around them. Let's see if the intuition is reflected in the wiki pages!

The degrees of the three friends are as follows:

| **Character**     | **Total degree** | **In-degree**     | **Out-degree**     |
| ---        |    :----: |          :---:| :----:|
| Harry Potter    | 294       | 178   | 116   |
| Hermione Granger  | 226        | 138      | 88   |
| Ron Weasly      |  157        | 58      | 99   |

From the distribution of all total degrees of the characters in [last post](https://jennyjyu.github.io/socialgraphs-projectB/posts/post-3/) (the red plot), it is clear that Harry is the one with the highest degree. This does make sense as he is the main character. Hermione has a degree of 226, meaning that she is the character with the third highest degree. Ron is more among some other characters with a degree of 115.

### How important are his friends?

One of the questions from Project A was *"How important are his friends?"*. Now we know that Hermione is appearantly quite important, as she has a high total degree, whereas the majority is from the in-degree. Ron, on the other hand, is sadly not as important. His total degree is lower than the other two, in addition to having most of it coming from his out-degree. The latter meaning that his degree is mostly due to him mentioning many other characters. 

Still, they are both among the upper part of the degree distribution. Hence, even though they are not *as* important as each other and Harry, they do still play a central part.
