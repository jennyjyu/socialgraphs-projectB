To decide which characters that is the most important ones, we looked at the degree distributions of the different characters. To get a more detailed explanation of the degree distributions and how these were deduced, see post [3 - The Degree Distribution]({{< ref "/posts/post-3.md" >}} "3 - The Degree Distribution").

The top 5 most important characters according to the _in-degree_ and _out-degree_ are presented in the tabels below.

| **Character**    | **In-degree** |
| ---------------- | :-----------: |
| Harry Potter     |      178      |
| Hermione Granger |      138      |
| Albus Dumbledore |      132      |
| Draco Malfoy     |      94       |
| Severus Snape    |      93       |

| **Character**    | **Out-degree** |
| ---------------- | :------------: |
| Harry Potter     |      116       |
| Albus Dumbledore |      110       |
| Ronald Weasley   |       99       |
| Hermione Granger |       88       |
| Tom Riddle       |       88       |

As expected, we can see that Harry, Hermine and Ron are some of the most central characters. The friendship and centrality of these characters are explained in more detail in post [4 - Centrality of Harry and his Friends ]({{< ref "/posts/post-4.md" >}} "4 - Centrality of Harry and his Friends ").

Furthermore, one can observe that Albus Dumbledore is a very important character with respect to both in- and out-degree. This is not a big suprise as he is the headmaster of Hogwarts. Tom Riddle, better known as Lord Voldemort, alternatively as You-Know-Who, is obviously important as his actions provide the main conflict in the Harry Potter series. Lastly, Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape plays a central role in the ongoing rivalry between Griffindoor and Slythering.

**Attributes**

The attributes for the most important characters are presented in the table below.

| **Character**    | **Species** | **Gender** | **House**  |
| ---------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Harry Potter     |    Human    |    Male    | Gryffindor |
| Hermione Granger |    Human    |   Female   | Gryffindor |
| Ronald Weasley   |    Human    |    Male    | Gryffindor |
| Albus Dumbledore |    Human    |    Male    | Gryffindor |
| Draco Malfoy     |    Human    |    Male    | Slytherin  |
| Severus Snape    |    Human    |    Male    | Slytherin  |
| Tom Riddle       |    Human    |    Male    | Slytherin  |

Although we meet a huge variety of magical creatures in Harry Potter, one can deduce from the attribute-table that _humans_ play the most central role. It is important to differentiate beteeen people from the non-magical community and human beings with magical abilities. People without any magical abilities is reffered to as Muggles. All the characters presented as human beings in the table are people with magic blood inside them, usually reffered to as Wizards.

The majority of the characters in the Harry Potter universe are _males_, Hermine is the most prominent _female_ character.

A huge part of the plot in the series is about the _rivalry_ between the four Houses. _Slytherins_ and _Gryffindors_ are frequently pitted against each other, so there is no suprise that the most important characters belongs the these Houses. By observing the ongoing conflict and tension between between _Harry Potter_ and _Draco Malfoy_ throughout the years at hogwarts we gain insight into this rivalry.
