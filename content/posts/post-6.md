As mentioned earlier, the students at _Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry_ belong to one of the four Houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. But what does each Hogwarts House actually represent?

All the four Houses have distinctive values and characteristics which are important according to the traditions and history of the House. We have produced **wordclouds** for each House from the texts that were collected from the Wiki Fandom page for each character that belongs to the House. A _wordcloud_ is a graphical representation of the frequency of words in a text. The bigger a word appears, the more often itâ€™s mentioned within a given text and the more important it is.

Every house has its own emblematic animal which is a lion, snake, eagle and badger for the house of Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw respectively. These symbols are the inspiration for the design of the wordclouds presented below.

**Gryffindor**

From the wordcloud we can deduce that _Voldemort_, _death_ and _battle_ are the three most mentioned words on the Gryffindors wikipages. The Gryffindors are in fact known for their chivalry, daring and bravery which reflects why these words are of such importance. The bravery tends to come in handy when fighting dark wizards.

Another characteristic of Gryffindors is the importance of friendship and the desire to help others, especially when it comes to protecting their friends. This is reflected by the terms _friend_ and _family_ in the wordcloud. Harry, Hermine and Ron have a very strong friendship and it is said that _a Gryffindor friendship can overcome (almost) anything_.

**Slytherin**

Ambition, resourcefulness and intellect are characteristics that can place you in Slytherin. From the wordcloud we see that _Voldemort_ and _death_ are the most mentioned terms. This can be related to the fact that Slytherin has a reputation for being an evil House due to its connection to villainous characters.

**Ravenclaw**

Characters that belong to the House of Ravenclaw are known to be intelligent and hard-working students. This can be deduced from the wordcloud where we can observe that the words _school_, _professor_ and _student_ are of importance.

**Hufflepuff**

From the wordcloud we see that some of the most mentioned terms are _school_, _friend_ and _student_. Hufflepuffs are known for being trustworthy, loyal and hardworking people.

We observe that the terms _Voldemort_ and _death_ have lower importance compared to Slytherin and Gryffindor. This can be related to the fact that Hufflepuff has produced the fewest Dark witches and wizards of any House.

**Unknown**

The _Unknown_ category includes people, creatures, pets etc. who have not gone to Hogwarts and do not belong to any of the houses. From the wordcloud we observe that _Voldemort_, _ministry_ and _magic_ are some of the most frequent terms. This seems reasonable as many of the people in the unknown category are part of the Ministry of Magic.

It is clear that the wordclouds gives an insight into the most important traits related to each House. The characteristics of each House can be deduced by studying the wordcloud, but it is definitely easier for someone with domain knowledge about the Harry Potter universe.
