As mentioned earlier, the students at _Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry_ belongs to one of the four houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. But what does each Hogwarts house actually respresent?

All the four houses has distinctive values and characteristics which are important according the traditions and history of the house.
We have produced **wordclouds** from the texts that was collected from each characters page at the Harry Potter Wiki Fandom page. A _wordcloud_ is a graphical representation of the frequency of words in a text. The bigger a word appears, the more often itâ€™s mentioned within a given text and the more important it is.

Every house has its own emblematic animal which is a lion, snake, eagle and badger for the house of Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw respectively. These symbols are the inspiration for the design of the wordclouds presented below.

**Gryffindor**

From the wordcloud we can deduce that _Voldemort_, _death_ and _battle_ are the three most mentioned words on the Gryffindors wikipages. The Gryffindors are in fact known for their chivalry, daring and bravery which reflects why these words are of such importance. The bravery tends to come in handy when fighting dark wizards.

Another characteristic of Gryffindors is the importance of friendship and the desire to help others, especially when it comes to protecting their friends. This is reflected by the terms _friend_ and _family_ in the wordcloud. Harry, Hermine and Ron have a very strong friendship and it is said that _a Gryffindor friendship can overcome (almost) anything_.

**Slytherin**

Ambition, resourcefulness and intellect are characteristics that can place you in Slytherin. From the wordcloud we see that _Voldemort_ and _death_ are the most mentioned terms. This can be related to the fact that Slytherin has a reputation for being an evil house due to its connection to villainous characters.

**Ravenclaw**

Characters that belong to the house of ravenclaw are known to be intelligent and hard-working students. This can be deduced from the wordcloud where we can observe that the words _school_, _professor_ and _student_ are of importance.

**Hufflepuff** Hard work, patience, loyalty, and fair play.

It is clear that the wordclouds gives an insight in the most important traits releated to each House. The characterteristics of each house can be deduced by studying the wordcloud, but it is easier for someone with domain knowledge about the Harry Potter universe.
